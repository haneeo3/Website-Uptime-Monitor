# Website-Uptime-Monitor
The Website Uptime Monitor is a serverless cloud-based monitoring system that automatically checks if websites are online every 5 minutes. If any website goes down, it sends an instant alert via AWS SNS (email notification) and logs the event in AWS DynamoDB for tracking uptime history.
